# Defold Entity Manager

_version 3.0 for LÃ–VE2D -- (October 3rd, 2019)_

This is a small Lua module for keeping track of existing entities of various types. This is my way of knowing if the enemy the player is targeting still exists, if any players are alive, if the enemy I just killed was the last one, when the player is killed, etc.
